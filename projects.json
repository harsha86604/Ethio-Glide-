    "description": "Built a big data pipeline to process 94.5M+ rows of NYC DOT Traffic Speeds data using Apache Spark on Google Cloud Dataproc. Integrated ELK stack for monitoring and visualization.",
    "longDescription": "This project focused on leveraging big data technologies to handle massive traffic datasets from NYC DOT. Using Apache Spark on Google Cloud Dataproc, the system efficiently processed 94.5 million+ rows of traffic speed data to detect congestion trends. The ELK stack was integrated for monitoring pipelines and visualizing insights in real time.",
    "problem": "Traffic congestion in large cities leads to lost productivity and environmental impact. Traditional systems often fail to process large-scale traffic datasets efficiently.",
    "solution": "Designed a scalable pipeline with Apache Spark on GCP, enabling distributed data processing. Integrated Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) for visualization and system monitoring.",
    "results": "Processed 94.5M+ rows in under 10 minutes. Achieved accurate congestion trend detection and provided real-time dashboards for city planning use cases.",

    "description": "Developed an intelligent book recommendation system using Python, LangChain, and Hugging Face Transformers. Implemented vector search with OpenAI embeddings for semantic similarity.",
    "longDescription": "This project built a semantic recommendation engine for books. Instead of keyword matching, the system uses embeddings to capture semantic meaning, allowing users to get book suggestions based on content similarity.",
    "problem": "Traditional recommendation systems rely on collaborative filtering or keyword searches, which fail to capture deeper semantic relationships.",
    "solution": "Leveraged Hugging Face Transformers and OpenAI embeddings with LangChain for semantic similarity. Vector search was implemented using FAISS for efficient retrieval.",
    "results": "Delivered highly accurate book recommendations by meaning rather than keywords. Successfully deployed on Hugging Face Spaces with interactive search.",
